1. Setting F_SEAL_SHRINK and F_SEAL_GROW after ftruncate()

Yes, this can be done.
Setting F_SEAL_SHRINK and F_SEAL_GROW after the ftruncate() call above could catch
some potential errors related to improper access to the shared memory allocated by
the SharedMemObject.

That would match how we deal with hardware ISPs, and I think that's a
good idea. It will help decoupling the processing side from the IPA.

3. Remove statsReady signal

> class SwStatsCpu
> {
> 	/**
> 	 * \brief Signals that the statistics are ready
> 	 */
> 	Signal<> statsReady;

But better, I wonder if the signal could be dropped completely. The
SwStatsCpu class does not operate asynchronously. Shouldn't whoever
calls the finishFrame() function then handle emitting the signal ?

Now, the trouble is that this would be the DebayerCpu class, whose name
doesn't indicate as a prime candidate to handle stats. However, it
already exposes a getStatsFD() function, so we're already calling for
trouble :-) Either that should be moved to somewhere else, or the class
should be renamed. Considering that the class applies colour gains in
addition to performing the interpolation, it may be more of a naming
issue.

Removing the signal and refactoring those classes doesn't have to be
addressed now, I think it would be part of a larger refactoring
(possibly also considering platforms that have no ISP but can produce
stats in hardware, such as the i.MX7), but please keep it on your radar.

4. Hide internal representation of gains from callers

> struct DebayerParams {
> 	static constexpr unsigned int kGain10 = 256;

Forcing the caller to deal with the internal representation of gains
isn't nice, especially given that it precludes implementing gains of
different precisions in different backend. Wouldn't it be better to pass
the values as floating point numbers, and convert them to the internal
representation in the implementation of process() before using them ?

5. Store ISP parameters in per-frame buffers

> /**
>  * \fn void Debayer::process(FrameBuffer *input, FrameBuffer *output, DebayerParams params)
>  * \brief Process the bayer data into the requested format.
>  * \param[in] input The input buffer.
>  * \param[in] output The output buffer.
>  * \param[in] params The parameters to be used in debayering.
>  *
>  * \note DebayerParams is passed by value deliberately so that a copy is passed
>  * when this is run in another thread by invokeMethod().
>  */

Possibly something to address later, by storing ISP parameters in
per-frame buffers like we do for hardware ISPs.

6. Input buffer copying configuration

> DebayerCpu::DebayerCpu(std::unique_ptr<SwStatsCpu> stats)
> 	: stats_(std::move(stats)), gammaCorrection_(1.0)
> {
> 	enableInputMemcpy_ = true;

Set this appropriately and/or make it configurable.

7. Performance measurement configuration

> void DebayerCpu::process(FrameBuffer *input, FrameBuffer *output, DebayerParams params)
> /* Measure before emitting signals */
> if (measuredFrames_ < DebayerCpu::kLastFrameToMeasure &&
>     ++measuredFrames_ > DebayerCpu::kFramesToSkip) {
> 	timespec frameEndTime = {};
> 	clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, &frameEndTime);
> 	frameProcessTime_ += timeDiff(frameEndTime, frameStartTime);
> 	if (measuredFrames_ == DebayerCpu::kLastFrameToMeasure) {
> 		const unsigned int measuredFrames = DebayerCpu::kLastFrameToMeasure -
> 						    DebayerCpu::kFramesToSkip;
> 		LOG(Debayer, Info)
> 			<< "Processed " << measuredFrames
> 			<< " frames in " << frameProcessTime_ / 1000 << "us, "
> 			<< frameProcessTime_ / (1000 * measuredFrames)
> 			<< " us/frame";
> 	}
> }

I wonder if there would be a way to control at runtime when/how to
perform those measurements. Maybe that's a bit overkill.

Yes, that I understood from the review. "necessary evil" is indeed the
right term :-) I expect it will take quite some design skills to balance
the need for performances and the need for a maintainable architecture.
